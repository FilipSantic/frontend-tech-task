# BE frontend-tech-task
This is my first React project I've ever made.

# These are the instructions for the project
Create a new project using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Create a git repository and push the initial commit without your changes.

You can run it with `npm start`.

Replace h1 with a new component.

Component specification:
- on startup you should get and store 2 random colors from `GET http://www.colr.org/json/color/random`
- clicking the component should toggle the color between black and 1 random color out of the 2 stored random colors

Add a text input on the page.
Changing the text on the input should change the text on the component above.

- No requirements regarding implementation.
- Feel free to add dependencies.
- Can use fetch for the API call for random color.
- Bonus for tests.

Push your changes.
